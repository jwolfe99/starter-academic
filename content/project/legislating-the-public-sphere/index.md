Independence marked a watershed in the conceptualization of politics across Spanish America. The notions of popular sovereignty, citizenship, and individual rights transformed how politics was understood, debated, and practiced. Throughout Spanish America, a stunned colonial oligarchy tried to navigate the loss of legal privileges in the face of plebeian demands for a reimagined social order. The result was conflict, often violent, and a political system only haltingly responsive to public opinion. The civil wars that wracked the region after independence gave vent to decades of pent up popular political discontent, much of it related to Bourbon-era colonial policies. How do you create a public sphere—where all are welcomed to political debate and the state responds—under such inauspicious conditions? This paper takes up these questions in early nineteenth-century Nicaragua, arguing that a generation of radical liberals, most of whom came from plebeian urban barrios and came of age after independence, found the answer in the law.
