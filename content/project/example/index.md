My current project is a microhistory of the port of Greytown/San Juan del Norte—the eastern terminus of the Gold Rush-era transit route across Nicaragua. For centuries, explorers, politicians, scientists, and merchants dreamed of an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua. In 1848, this dream seemed on the verge of realization, when British forces claimed sovereignty over the port town of San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua, the transit route’s Atlantic starting point, rechristening it Greytown in honor of Jamaica’s then-governor.

With the discovery of gold in California in 1849, the canal seemed even more urgent. Thousands of people make the trek through the isthmus; between 1850 and 1855, more than 80,000 people flooded across Nicaragua. As steamships began to arrive, Greytown evolved from a quiet village of a few dozen huts to a bustling town of hotels, stores, billiard halls, bars, storehouses, and the like. In 1852, as Americans poured in and Greytown began to challenge the Panamanian transit route, the British converted Greytown into a free port, with a constitution that provided universal manhood suffrage. The men of African descent—from the U.S., the Caribbean, and Nicaragua—who formed the town’s electoral majority, embraced this experiment in political freedom and opportunity. For pro-slavery travelers and observers, Greytown produced fevered visions of emancipation’s prospects in the U.S. By 1854, the collision of these forces led the United States to bombard and torch the entire port. 

Against the scholarship’s tendency to frame this as an episode in the “Southern dream of Caribbean empire” or an expression of white “othering,” this project uses a microhistorical approach that places the residents of Greytown at the center of debates on slavery, empire and social equality.
