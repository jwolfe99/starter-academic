Justin Wolfe is a professor of Latin American history at Tulane University. His work explores the social and cultural history over the long nineteenth-century, particularly the construction of identity within the context of everyday politics. At the same time, he seeks to cross back and forth over the boundaries between social scientific and cultural analysis, to explore the interconnections between structure and imagining. Wolfe is also interested in the relationship between history and documentary filmmaking through parallel practices and questions of narrative form, visual and aural evidence, expertise and authority, and the ethics of representation.
