abstract: Many of the earliest Africans to arrive in the Americas came to
  Central America with Spanish colonists in the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries, and people of African descent constituted the majority of
  nonindigenous populations in the region long thereafter. Yet in the
  development of national identities and historical consciousness, Central
  American nations have often countenanced widespread practices of social,
  political, and regional exclusion of blacks. The postcolonial development of
  mestizo or mixed-race ideologies of national identity have systematically
  downplayed African ancestry and social and political involvement in favor of
  Spanish and Indian heritage and contributions. In addition, a powerful sense
  of place and belonging has led many peoples of African descent in Central
  America to identify themselves as something other than African American,
  reinforcing the tendency of local and foreign scholars to see Central America
  as peripheral to the African diaspora in the Americas. The essays in this
  collection begin to recover the forgotten and downplayed histories of blacks
  in Central America, demonstrating the centrality of African Americans to the
  region’s history from the earliest colonial times to the present. They reveal
  how modern nationalist attempts to define mixed-race majorities as
  “Indo-Hispanic,” or as anything but African American, clash with the
  historical record of the first region of the Americas in which African
  Americans not only gained the right to vote but repeatedly held high office,
  including the presidency, following independence from Spain in 1821.
