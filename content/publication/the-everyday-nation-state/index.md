summary: "After Nicaragua achieved independence from Spain in 1821, it suffered
  a series of conflicts culminating in the two-year National War. When that war
  ended in 1857, Nicaragua was in ruins. *The Everyday Nation-State* explores
  what followed: the intersection of nation-state formation and everyday life in
  nineteenth-century Nicaragua. Rather than focus on the “invented traditions”
  of anthems, marches, and memorials that convey and reproduce an established
  sense of national identity and belonging, this work analyzes how such feelings
  emerged in the struggles of local communities over political authority,
  identity, and legitimacy. Based on extensive research of court cases, land
  registries, census materials, correspondence, government publications, and
  newspapers, *The Everyday Nation-State* connects the local with the national,
  prizing the narratives of commoners, while placing them in the larger regional
  and historical context, and challenging the way we approach the study of the
  nation-state."
